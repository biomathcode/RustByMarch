I have decided to learn Rust as a web developer. If the trends and what i have heard is true. Web is becoming more powerful and performant. 


Also, a lot of crypto ecosystem in using rust as in building big projects. For example i got to know solana projects use rust a lot.  




Here is the roadmap that i have decided to take. Hope it will help you as well. I will be sharing my learning. I guess it's the best way to learn.

### 1 Setup <a name="setup"></a>

I downloaded rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). 

Code editor : vscode

Rust has this cargo package manager and packages are called crates.

### 2. Understand the Basics. <a name="understanding"></a>

 - https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

I will be reading this book for the 1-2 week. Go through basic concept and syntax of the language. I learn better and faster by reading and iterating in the code editor. Also, I want to have a good understanding of the language concept. Learning by video is a bit slow and i am not really doing anything. I get stimulated that i have learnt something but in reality i have done nothing of my own.

### 3. Learn with examples. <a name="examples"></a>

- https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/


I will be spending my first 2-3 week with this books. Learning the basics and making simple example project from the second book.

After finishing the two, doesn't matter how much time it take. I would be able to do it in like 1 to 2 months. That much is enough to go through the staff once. Obviously, the aim is to start building projects in rust.

### 4. Rust and web Assembly <a name="web"></a>

- https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/

Finally working with web assembly and rust together. The best way to build a cross platform project or app is to use the web. 



This will probably will be my last book. At least as per the plan. I will be sharing if i discover new resources to learn. 
I am trying to restrict myself to this three book only for now. 


Do let me know if you guys already have some resources with me in the comments.

### 5. Build  Large scale project <a name="building"></a>

I don't have any idea right now. I will be collecting ideas as i learn. Suggest me what i should build with rust.
